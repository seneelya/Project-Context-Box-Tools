"""Vision05 — query-escalation: expand a too-small/uninformative `--query` result by
rewriting the CALL PARAMETERS (`--line`/`--level` arrays) before they reach the existing,
already-tested batch-query resolve/render path (`core._resolve_query_runs` /
`core._render_query_runs`). Adds no new rendering path and no new engine — only decides
WHICH `--line`/`--level` combo to hand to the existing ones.

Design (see `__dev/vision/Vision05__get_codeblock.md` for the full rationale):
- Resolve-once for the common case: `core.py` resolves the ORIGINAL anchors exactly
  once (it would have anyway, escalation or not) and passes those `runs` in here — this
  module only pays for MORE resolves (probing neighbors) when that seed turns out too
  small, never re-derives what's already been computed.
- Horizontal by default: grab SIBLING blocks at the same (deepest-resolved) level, left and
  right in file order, instead of climbing to a parent — a vertical climb can jump into a
  giant enclosing block disproportionately (a `try` inside a 1000-line method).
- Applies to explicit multi-anchor batches too: every anchor first resolves to its own
  absolute level; the REFERENCE level for sibling-gathering is the MAX (deepest) among them.
  A single anchor is just the n=1 case of the same rule.
- Never touches the importable `get_codeblock()` API — this lives only in the CLI dispatch
  path (`core.py`), same boundary Vision04 draws between "core raises structure" and
  "policy decides what to show".

KNOWN, DEFERRED cost: every `handler.get_blocks()`/`line_level()` call re-reads and
re-parses the whole file from scratch (no shared parse-tree cache across calls — true
throughout `reader/address.py` and `reader/classify.py`, not just here). Measured:
~0.8ms/call on a 27-line file, ~75ms/call on a 4747-line file. This module's neighbor
probes each cost one such call, on top of whatever `_resolve_query_runs` already paid.
A proper fix (in-process parse-tree cache keyed by path, shared across all ~7 entry
points in `address.py`+`classify.py`) is a deliberate LATER, separate pass — not folded
into Vision05 to keep this change reviewable. Vision05 only removes the ONE redundant
resolve this module used to do on top of that pre-existing cost (see "Resolve-once"
above); it doesn't fix the underlying no-cache architecture.
