"""CSS / SCSS / Sass handler for get_codeblock.

Navigation (outline / get_blocks / line_level) comes from the shared tree-sitter
block engine. A "block" is a rule set's brace body `selector { … }`; nested rules
(SCSS `&::before { … }`, `@media`/`@include` blocks) nest naturally, and the label
is the selector list.

Grammar note: we use `tree-sitter-css`. The dedicated `tree-sitter-scss` package
(1.0.0) ships an old-ABI `language()` that overflows on 64-bit Windows with
tree-sitter >= 0.26, so it is unusable here. The css grammar flags SCSS-only
syntax (`@mixin`, `@include`, `@if`, `&` interpolation) as ERROR nodes, but the
surrounding rule/selector/nesting structure still parses — which is exactly what
navigation needs. Good enough to work across a real SCSS codebase.

Requires: pip install tree-sitter tree-sitter-css

    """cursor_feedback__gcb.md #5 — a top-level (brace-depth 0) SCSS variable declaration
    (`$name: value;`) isn't valid CSS, and unlike `@mixin`/`@include`/`&`-interpolation
    (which stay contained — the docstring above is right about those), tree-sitter-css's
    recovery from one at depth 0 can cascade into losing the parse of the REST OF THE
    FILE: `root.type` itself comes back 'ERROR' and everything downstream fragments into
    single-token ERROR/operator nodes, not one clean node per statement (verified on the
    reported fixture — `__dev/Requests/globals.scss`). A `$var:` NESTED inside a rule
    block is a separate, milder case (confirmed): the damage stays inside that one
    block's body, the next sibling rule parses fine — so it is intentionally left alone.

    Fix: rewrite each top-level `$name: value;` into a same-length, same-line-count real
    CSS COMMENT (`/*...*/`) before parsing — always valid, anywhere, so the surrounding
    real rules parse cleanly again. classify.py already renders a comment band's first
    line as its label, so the outline ends up showing the actual variable text instead of
    an opaque `~ERROR` — visible and honest, not swallowed.

    Best-effort, not a parser: found by a lightweight string/comment-aware brace-depth
    scan, not a real grammar, so a value containing a literal `*/` or a `$`-interpolation
    (`#{$var}`) starting its own line could still slip through uncaught — acceptable,
    the common case (bare variable declarations before any rule) is what actually
    happens in practice and is what this fixes.
